			<h3>DC Influencers Events Map</h3>
			<p>I was curious about the geographic distribution of events posted by various DC 'Influencers.' Here are the locations of events posted by the different accounts for July 2024. Event info gathered from Instagram or the corresponding site. The Wayback Machine was used for data no longer posted.</p>
			<p>Dot size indicates the number of events at the same location in the same month from the same account.</p>
			<p>Not all samples are comprehensive of all events for the whole month. Clockout DC, 730 DC, and Washingtonian are limited to week-long samples from the middle of July, due to number of events compared to other sources and archiving hurdles.</p>
